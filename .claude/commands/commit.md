# Smart Commit
Look at the current staged and unstaged changes using git diff and git status.
1. Analyze what was changed and categorize it (feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore)
2. Generate a conventional commit message that accurately describes the changes
3. Show me the proposed commit message and ask for approval
4. If approved, stage all relevant files and commit
5. Do NOT push — I will push manually when ready

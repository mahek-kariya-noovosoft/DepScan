# Test and Verify
1. Run all tests: `npm test` in both client/ and server/
2. If any tests fail, analyze why and fix them
3. After all tests pass, do a quick sanity check:
    - Does the code match the requirements in CLAUDE.md?
    - Are there any TODO comments left?
    - Are there any `any` types in TypeScript?
    - Are all error cases handled?
4. Report a summary of what passed, what was fixed, and any remaining concerns.

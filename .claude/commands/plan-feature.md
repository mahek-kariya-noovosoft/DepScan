# Plan Feature
Interview me about the feature I want to build. Ask me 3-5 questions one at a time to understand:
1. What exactly should this feature do?
2. What inputs and outputs does it have?
3. Any edge cases I'm worried about?
4. How should it connect to existing code?

After the interview, produce a detailed implementation plan with:
- Files to create/modify
- Key functions and their signatures
- Test cases to write
- Estimated complexity

Do NOT write any code yet. Only plan.
